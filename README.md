# Book-Inventory-GUI-OOP
To execute this app, execute the "frontend.py" file. 

My previous Book Inventory GUI app was built using functions.
This app will show the same app but built using OOP. 


I found it is good practice to organize funcs in a class if more than 2 funcs apply operations to the same object.
Here, the object is the entire window with it's buttons and widgets. 

In backend.py, I put all attributes that define the object inside a class called Database.
In frontend.py, I put all funcs in class called Window and created an init function where I put the window and all its widgets.
